If on Windows: Install Python through the Windows Store and then run the .bat file.
PYGAME is automatically installed through the .bat file.
This is recommended even if you use WSL.

If you're using WSL and don't want to run a .bat file, make sure you have a XServer
running on your machine for LINUX graphical applications.

If on LINUX:
Run the command: pip install PYGAME
Only run it if you don't already have PYGAME installed on your LINUX machine.
Otherwise just run the game.py script through python.

OR:
Download and install from the latest release.
