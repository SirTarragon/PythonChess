The separation of work largely became highly mixed during the development of this project, below is the original separation of work from our project proposal submission:

* [Jose Ramirez](https://github.com/joantram): Developing the chess game in Python to make it work, either with the use of the python-chess library if permitted or completely from scratch.  Will also help with developing elsewhere for the chess game as needed.

* [Tyler Pease](https://github.com/SirTarragon): Developing the General User Interface for the game itself – interfacing with the board to allow for better visibility, with potential move highlighting for visibility as well as helping with developing the chess game.

* [Tyler McLanahan](https://github.com/tylermclanahan): Developing the saving and loading mechanics for the database – hopefully to save every move made by both black and white and to be able to load back to that state as well as helping with developing the chess game.

* [Brandon Smith](https://github.com/brandonsmith-prgrms): Developing the capability of being able to easily revert moves by the player into a stack like Python-Chess as it may prove useful if able to be saved and for bug testing. Will do preliminary research into what we need for WebSockets to allow for two-player separate device playability, and will help with developing the chess game.
