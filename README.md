# PythonChess
This repository contains everything for our Python class. It's a simple chess game with a save and load state capability, player versus player and player versus AI.

PROBLEM:
	To develop a playable chess game wihtout any game specific libraries through Python with several 
features. The features that were sought to be accomplished are listed below.
	- Enable saving/loading of matches
	- Ability to play against another person (on same or separate terminals)
	- A clean and effective GUI system for visual representation of gameplay

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USER INTERFACE (OUTSIDE THE OBVIOUS):

LIST OF PYTHON LIBRARIES USED:
pygame - 

EXTRA FEATURES IMPLEMENTED (BEYOND PROJECT PROPOSAL):

SEPARATION OF WORK:
Jose Ramirez: Developing the chess game in Python to make it work, either with the use of the python-chess library if permitted or completely from scratch.  
Tyler Pease: Developing the General User Interface for the game itself – interfacing with the board to allow for better visibility, with potential move highlighting for visibility – as well as helping with developing the chess game. 
Tyler McLanahan: Developing the saving and loading mechanics for the database – hopefully to save every move made by both black and white and to be able to load back to that state – as well as helping with developing the chess game.
Brandon Smith: Developing the capability of being able to easily revert moves by the player into a stack like Python-Chess as it may prove useful if able to be saved and for bug testing. Will do preliminary research into what we need for WebSockets to allow for two-player separate device playability, and will help with developing the chess game.
